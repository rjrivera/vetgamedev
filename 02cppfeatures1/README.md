The initial INTRODUCTION module provided a 'zero-hour' crash course to programming, focusing less on the language and more on the logic and thinking of declarative programming. This next module will introduce the layout and features of the cpp language with an aim towards good Object-Oriented Design (OOD). 

# cppfeatures1

## intro

The C++ language is designed by committee and heavily documented. Even with such oversight, there are still substantial ways to introduce 'undefined behavior' unintentionally. Accept the fact that you will never be an expert in the langauge; mark this as the start of a life-long learning process. Plenty of employed and talented engineers still find themselves learning new things.

This module will focus on the details of functions, classes, structs. The devil is in the details. 

## overview

-Function signatures

-call-by-value vs call-by-reference

-structs

-classes

## conclustion

Being able to slap together a program that runs tetris and an elegant and modular implementation of tetris is the difference between a student and a professional seeking work. The motivation behind these lessons is the understanding that they are necessary skillsets for designing and implementing games.
