Technology Stack:

OS         - ubuntu (linux)

Editor     - VIM

Compiler   - GCC

build tool - makefile

Pedagogy:

The student will incrementally learn how to use this technology stack as a vehicle for understanding how software development is accomplished at a practical level. The most common Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is the windows friendly Microsoft Visual Studios. Instruction will not utilize this environment. The student will be 'thrown into the deep-end' with unix as a first-line of defense against velociraptors (the real enemy). 

Usage:

Google is your friend. The technology names and errors associated with them will almost always yield a stackoverflow link that will have a well written response. 

The cloud9 web platform should already have the gcc compiler installed. To test it, navigate to vetgamedev/introduction/02hello-world/ and run the 'make' command. The prefabricated makefile will run the necessary gcc commands to compile and link the helloworld.cpp file into an executable. 

To Navigate: 
cd ..          - move up a directory

cd /[dir name] - move down into a directory [dir name]

ls             - list all files and directories in current directory

rm             - remove a file

You can perform advanced features of these linux commands using 'flags' 
Flags will be taught later after familiarization with navigation is attained. 

To Install software:
sudo apt-get install [softwarename]

proceed to install 'make' program if it is not installed:
sudo apt-get install make
