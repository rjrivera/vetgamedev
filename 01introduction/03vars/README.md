VARIABLES AND DATATYPES

All computer memory is composed of '1' and '0'. However, a computer must know what those numbers represent. Some data types can be 32 bits, others 64, or any random numer of digits.

Data types communicate to the computer (through the compiler) the size of memory required to store the data, and how it can be manipulated. 

Examples of data types include (but not limited to): string, char, int, double

The CPP language (as well as most languages) contain what are called 'primitive data types'. These data types are built into the language. We will use only these primitive data types.

TODO:
[ ] review vars1.cpp and perform the TODO's annotated
[ ] review vars2.cpp, complete the TODO's, edit the makefile to compile vars2.cpp, compile and execute.
