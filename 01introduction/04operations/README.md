OPERATIONS

You know how to use a calculator and understand PEMDAS, congratulations you understand operations! The devil is always in the details. Below is a non-exhaustive list of operators in c++ (google for a complete listing):

+   -   Addition Operator

-   -   Subtraction Operator

*   -   multiplication Operator

/   -   division Operator

%   -   modulo Operator


All are self-explanatory say for modulo; modulo is the 'remainder' value after a division, eg. 5%2 = 1, 10&2 = 0, 4 & 2 = 0 

These operatrions can be combined with the assignment operator ('=') to form a 'compound assignment'. A compound assignment is a common operation, especially in iterative processes. A compound operation applies the Right hand value to the left hand value and then assignes it to the variable. Wait, what did I just say? Let me write it out:

a = 5;                 =>      a = 5;

a += 10; // a = 15     =>      a = a + 10// a = 15

Does that clear up that statement for you? I certainly hope so! Moving on.


Understanding the basic operators is essential for program flow control. There are other operators, and we will tackle them as we get there. For instance, the increment and decrement operators (++/--) are used in for-loops
