Hello world is the classic introduction to a language. It prints a simple message of "hello world" to the command line.  

Verify the tech prereqs are met by building the application and executing it:
make
./helloworld     (to run an executable from the cmd line, prefix it by './')

afterwards, open the program and walk through it line by line:

vim helloworld.cpp

VIM LESSON: 
when initially opening a file in VIM, you are in command-mode, which takes certain commands. 

to enter INSERT mode, press the key 'a'

after you are done editing a file with vim, press 'ESC' to return to COMMAND mode.

in COMMAND mode, save the program by entering ':w'

in COMMAND mode, quit the program by entering ':q'

PROTIP: you can concatenate the commands with ':wq'
